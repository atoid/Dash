# Dash

Motorcycle dashboard app for Andoid

This app interfaces with DashBle device to fetch interesting information from motorcycle ECU to phone screen. For example RPM, speed,
temperatures, battery voltage can be decoded from the ECU information tables.

The app has simple layout with GPS centered map and grid of realtime ECU information.

Default gear ratios are set for stock Honda CB500F. Gear ratios can be set in a dialog in the app. Put the bike on a stand,
start the bike and set on gear 1. When ratio settles, tap 'Gear 1' and the ratio is set for the gear. Go through all gears and 
tap 'Save' when ready. Now the app should find correct gear from speed/RPM ratio. If no gear is found, ratio is shown instead.

Some bikes might report the exact gear in the table data, maybe that could be an option in the app?

The app handles Honda specific table numbers 0x11 and 0xD1. The table numbers may vary between Honda models, but the data is
pretty much the same. For different tables to be reported, some changes are required in DashBle ECU interfacing code.

See the DashBle repository for the ECU interfacing.

## Honda ECU tables 11 and D1

Dash EcuData class currently parses tables 0x11 and 0xD1 which contain useful information and those tables are also somewhat
decoded 'in the internet'.

### Table 11

Full message from idling CB500F bike. Offset in decimal, data in hex. Values at offsets 21, 22, 23 seem to change a lot in
the start of ride. After a while they reach stable values like hex 45, 12, 71. Maybe some value shows AFR, fuel level, 
fuel consumption...? Need to collect more logs to figure them out.

| Offset | Data | Description |
| -- | -- | --- |
|  0 | 02 | Sender (ECU) |
|  1 | 19 | Length |
|  2 | 71 | Cmd |
|  3 | 11 | Table nbr |
|  4 | 06 | RPM hi byte |
|  5 | A2 | RPM lo byte |
|  6 | 1C | TPS voltage |
|  7 | 00 | TPS (0-121) |
|  8 | B8 | ECT voltage |
|  9 | 32 | ECT degrees in Celcius, offset -40 |
| 10 | B7 | IAT voltage |
| 11 | 33 | IAT degrees in Celcius, offset -40 |
| 12 | 72 | MAP voltage |
| 13 | 4C | MAP kPa |
| 14 | FF | ? |
| 15 | FF | ? |
| 16 | 8B | Battery voltage, divide by 10 |
| 17 | 00 | Speed in km/h |
| 18 | 04 | Injectors hi byte? |
| 19 | 35 | Injectors lo byte? |
| 20 | 98 | Scaled AFR? |
| 21 | 5B | ? |
| 22 | 17 | ? |
| 23 | 23 | ? |
| 24 | 1E | Checksum |

* TPS = Throttle Position Sensor
* ECT = Engine Coolant Temp
* IAT = Intake Air Temp
* MAP = Manifold Absolute Pressure
* AFR = Air Fuel Ratio

### Table D1

Full message from idling CB500F bike. Offset in decimal, data in hex. Engine byte at offset 8 seems to get different values during
ride. I've seen hex values 01, 13, 09, 05 and during ride value 13 seems to be the most common.

| Offset | Data | Description |
| -- | -- | --- |
|  0 | 02 | Sender (ECU) |
|  1 | 0B | Length |
|  2 | 71 | Cmd |
|  3 | D1 | Table nbr |
|  4 | 01 | Engine off = bit 7 is set, 1 = neutral, 3 = kickstand |
|  5 | 00 | ? |
|  6 | 00 | ? |
|  7 | 00 | ? |
|  8 | 01 | Engine on = 1, off = 0, other values too|
|  9 | 00 | ? |
| 10 | AF | Checksum |
